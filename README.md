# remote_layout

Package for implementing layout dependencies between remote parts of the render tree

## Disclaimer
This is still very early in development and I haven't finalized the API. You're welcome to use it, but it's not stable yet.
First stable version will be 1.0.0. Hopefully not too far off.
